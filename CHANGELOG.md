# Changelog
Version 0.10.3:
* Added function vm_functions.vm_disable_time_sync() and option to disable host-guest time sync ('--no_time_sync').

Version 0.10.2:
* Added option to check VirtualBox version online (--check_version). Will warn if outdated version is used.
Windows binary does not have this option.
* Fixed '--log' option.

Version 0.10.1:
* Added function vm_functions.vm_memdump() and option to dump VM memory (--memdump).
This may take some time and disk space.
* Added script to build Windows binary using [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/). See 'scripts' folder.

Version 0.10:
* Added option to dump all VM's network traffic to the file ('--pcap'). File will be saved as {vm_name}_{snapshot}.pcap.
* Added option '--get_file' to download file (memory dumps, logs, reports, etc) before stopping VM.
* Removed option 'keep' for all of the arguments. Omitting argument will do the same.
* Added function vm_set_mac(vm, mac) and option to change MAC address for VM before start.
Can be set to specific MAC ('--mac 80AABBCCDDEE'), 'new' for random mac in VirtualBox range or 'random' for random one.
* Logs levels tweaked to make default output more clean.
* Added argument '--debug' (alias for '--verbosity debug').
* Added standalone Windows binary. See releases section for download.

Version 0.9.2:
* Added option '--delay' to control delay before/after starting VMs. Depends on hardware performance.
* Added md5 checksum calculation.
* Updated html report generation logic.
* Additional check to make sure that number of thread <= number of VMs.

Version 0.9.1:
* Added check for original file at the end of analysis.
* Added more data to html report.
* Small cleanups.

Version 0.9:
* Added option to generate html report ('--report'). Result (including screenshots) will be saved under ./reports/<file_hash> directory.
* Added option to record video from guest VM ('--record output.webm').

* Added option 'dictionary' for list_vms() function. List of VMs will be returned as {'vm': '/group'} dictionary.
* Added function to clone VM - vm_clone().
* Added function to record guest screen - vm_record().
* Added option to restore current snapshot: vm_snapshot_restore('vm', 'restorecurrent').
* Updated vm_screenshot() function - code to generate image index moved to main script.
* All files converted to Unix EOL (LF).

Version 0.7.3:
* Docstring added for all the functions (Sphinx format). Usage: help(function_name).
* Added functions to export and import VMs - vm_export() and vm_import(). Have separate timeout settings as operations are time consuming.

* Added aliases for vm_copyto() and vm_copyfrom() functions - vm_upload() and vm_download().
* Fixed command line arguments processing.
* Added unittests for some of the functions ('tests/test.py').
* Other minor updates for few functions.

Version 0.6.2:
* Bug fixes in list_snapshots() function.

Version 0.6.1:
* All vm_functions are now returning exactly 3 values: [exit_code, stdout, stderr].
* New function to get IP addresses of guest - vm_functions.list_ips(vm).
* Fixes in arguments parser.

Version 0.6:
* Script now can use all available VMs ('--vms all') and snapshots ('--snapshots all'). Use with caution and make sure you have only testing VMs.
* New function to get list of snapshots for specific VM - vm_functions.list_snapshots().
* Script updated to handle keyboard interrupts (Ctrl+C).
* Option to set random screen resolution from most common ones ('--resolution random').
* Some tweaks and fixes.

Version 0.5:
* All functions moved to external files: vm_functions (all VM control functions) and support_functions (randomize filename, calculate a hash and show links to Google/VT).
* The main routine moved to file demo.py.
* New function to get list of VMs - vm_functions.list_vms().
* Fixed logic when the file was removed before execution - script will move on to the next task without waiting for a timeout.
